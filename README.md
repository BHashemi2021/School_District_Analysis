# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis 

The PyCitySchools analysis was performed on two separate datasets in csv format provided by School District authority, Maria. One of the datasets included data abut 15 schools of the city and the other was data on 39,170 students going to those schools. The first analysis was submitted upon completion but there is another call for a re-run of the analysis and exclusion of parts of the data as there has been concerns about academic misconduct regarding the 9th grade in Thomas High School. 
We have been tasked to do the analysis with three objectives: 
 •	Filter DataFrames using logical operators.
 •	Replace the incorrect values with NaN.
 •	Explain how PyCitySchools analysis changes after we exclude the incorrect data.
For the analysis we imported the datasets into Jupyter Notebook version 6.3.1 using Python Panadas. 

In a nutshell, the descriptive analysis of the study shows that the city has 15 schools (seven District type and 8 charter) and 39, 170 students and a total budget of $24, 649,428 (Table 1).

o	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

o	How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

  * Math and reading scores by grade
